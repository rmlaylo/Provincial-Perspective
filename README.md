# Provincial-Perspectives
 This study examines how Filipino families' finances shifted from 2018 to 2021 using data from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey. We identify significant income differences during this period, but no notable changes in savings and expenses. The focus narrows to two provinces with the highest and lowest income variations.
